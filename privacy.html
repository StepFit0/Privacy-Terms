      <h1>StepFit Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="accent-bar"></div>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>StepFit</strong> (“the App”)
        handles your data. StepFit is designed and developed by
        <strong>Iman Mirzazadegan</strong> as a personal pedometer and fitness
        companion. The App is intentionally built to minimize the amount of
        personal data collected and to keep your information primarily on your
        own device.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies to all versions of StepFit distributed through
        official app stores (such as Google Play) and covers all features
        available within the App, including step tracking, goals, history,
        widgets, notifications and Health Connect integration.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Step and activity data</h3>
      <p>
        StepFit uses your device’s motion sensors (e.g. step counter sensor)
        and/or Health Connect to read your daily step counts and related
        activity metrics. These values are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>stored locally on your device,</li>
        <li>used to calculate statistics such as daily totals and history,</li>
        <li>displayed in widgets and notifications for your convenience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>We do not send your step data to our own servers.</strong>
        All processing happens either on-device or through Health Connect,
        according to the permissions you grant.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Profile and configuration data</h3>
      <p>
        StepFit may optionally store profile information you provide, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name or nickname</li>
        <li>Age, gender, height, weight</li>
        <li>Preferred units (km / miles)</li>
        <li>Daily step goal and reminder time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used only to personalize your experience, for
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>calculating approximate distance or calories,</li>
        <li>showing age‑appropriate statistics,</li>
        <li>triggering reminders at the time you choose.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of this data is stored locally using Android’s secure storage
        mechanisms (DataStore / Room) and is not transmitted to external
        servers by StepFit.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Health Connect data</h3>
      <p>
        If you connect StepFit to <strong>Health Connect</strong>, the App may
        read the data types that you explicitly allow, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steps</li>
        <li>Distance</li>
        <li>Total calories burned</li>
        <li>Weight</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        StepFit uses this information only to display your activity inside the
        app and to keep your local statistics aligned with your existing
        health data. StepFit does not modify or delete external health records
        unless you explicitly enable write permissions for supported types
        (e.g. weight logs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Health Connect itself is operated by Google and is subject to Google’s
        separate privacy and security policies.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Notifications and reminders</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit can schedule local notifications to remind you to move or to
        inform you when you reach your daily goal. These notifications are
        created and handled entirely on your device. No notification content
        is sent to external servers by the App.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Analytics and third‑party services</h2>
      <p>
        At the time of this version, StepFit does not embed third‑party
        advertising SDKs or behavior‑tracking analytics. If in the future
        lightweight crash reporting or anonymous usage metrics are introduced
        to improve stability and UX, this section of the Policy will be
        updated to describe exactly what is collected and how it is processed.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Because StepFit stores data primarily on your device:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may clear your history, reset today’s steps or modify your
          profile directly from the app settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uninstalling the app removes all data stored by StepFit from your
          device.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you use Health Connect, that platform may continue to hold your
        data according to its own retention policy. You can manage Health
        Connect records separately via the Health Connect app or system
        settings.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit relies on Android’s security model and storage mechanisms.
        While no mobile app can guarantee absolute security, StepFit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>does not transmit your step or profile data to its own servers,</li>
        <li>
          limits permissions to what is necessary for pedometer and
          notification functionality,
        </li>
        <li>
          uses well‑known libraries and APIs from the Android Jetpack
          ecosystem.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is not directed at children under the age of 13. If you are a
        parent or guardian and believe that a child is using the App with
        personal information that should not be collected, you can remove that
        data by clearing the app settings or uninstalling the app on the
        relevant device.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect new
        functionality, legal requirements, or improvements in how data is
        handled. When significant changes are made, a new version of the
        Policy will be published together with the app update.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, how StepFit uses
        your data, or if you would like to suggest improvements, you can
        contact the developer:
