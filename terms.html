    <div class="card">
      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="accent-bar"></div>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of
        <strong>StepFit</strong> (“the App”), a pedometer and fitness companion
        developed by <strong>Iman Mirzazadegan</strong>. By installing or using
        StepFit you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is intended to help you monitor your daily activity, primarily
        steps, and to support your personal fitness goals. The App is not a
        medical device and does not provide medical advice or diagnoses. Any
        information or metrics shown are for general wellness and motivational
        purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Personal responsibility and health</h2>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for your own health decisions and physical
        activity. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before
        starting, changing or intensifying an exercise program, especially if
        you have existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or have concerns
        about your health.
      </p>
      <p>
        StepFit cannot be held liable for injuries, health issues, or damages
        that may occur as a result of following, misinterpreting, or ignoring
        activity signals shown in the App.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>When using StepFit, you agree that you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          reverse engineer, decompile or attempt to extract the source code of
          the App, except where allowed by applicable law;
        </li>
        <li>
          circumvent security mechanisms, usage limits, or tamper with step
          data for unfair advantage in competitions or challenges;
        </li>
        <li>
          distribute modified versions of the App without the prior written
          consent of the developer;
        </li>
        <li>
          use the App for any unlawful, harmful or abusive activities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Age requirements</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is not specifically aimed at children under the age of 13. If
        you are under 18 years old, you should only use the App with the
        knowledge and consent of a parent or legal guardian, and they should
        review these Terms and the Privacy Policy with you.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit primarily stores your data locally on your own device. No
        central StepFit account is required. Details regarding the categories
        of data and how they are handled are provided in the
        <strong>StepFit Privacy Policy</strong>, which forms part of these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the App you acknowledge that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          your step counts, profile and configuration may be processed locally
          to provide features such as history, goals and notifications;
        </li>
        <li>
          when you enable Health Connect integration, your data is additionally
          subject to that platform’s terms and privacy policies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Health Connect and third‑party platforms</h2>
      <p>
        If you connect StepFit with Health Connect or other health platforms,
        you remain responsible for reviewing and adjusting the permissions
        requested by StepFit, including which data types can be read or
        written.
      </p>
      <p>
        StepFit does not operate Health Connect or other third‑party
        ecosystems. Their terms, policies and technical limitations apply
        independently of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit, including its design, code, illustrations and icons, is
        protected by intellectual property laws. You are granted a
        non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App on
        devices that you own or control, solely for personal, non‑commercial
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, sell, lease or lend
        any part of the App except where allowed by applicable law or with
        prior written authorization from the developer.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes, updates and availability</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit may be updated from time to time to improve performance, fix
        issues, adapt to new platform requirements or introduce new features.
        We do not guarantee that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the App will always be available on all devices or stores;</li>
        <li>
          any particular functionality (such as a specific widget layout)
          will remain available indefinitely;
        </li>
        <li>
          all historical data will always be preserved across every future
          update or device migration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Disclaimer of warranty</h2>
      <p>
        StepFit is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and
        <strong>“as available”</strong> basis. To the fullest extent permitted
        by law, the developer makes no warranties, express or implied,
        including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for
        a particular purpose, accuracy, or non‑infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, we do not warrant that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the step count or other metrics will be perfectly accurate in all
          conditions or across all devices;
        </li>
        <li>
          the App will operate without interruption, delays, bugs or other
          technical issues;
        </li>
        <li>
          every issue will be corrected within a specific timeframe.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, the developer of StepFit shall not be
        liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
        punitive damages, nor for any loss of data, revenue, profits or
        reputation arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to
        use) the App.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, despite the above, liability is established, it shall be limited
        to the total amount (if any) that you have paid for using StepFit,
        excluding device costs, data plans, or payments to third‑party
        services.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using StepFit at any time by uninstalling the App from
        your device. We may suspend, restrict or discontinue the App, or any
        part of it, at any time and for any reason, including but not limited
        to technical, legal, or platform‑policy requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms may be updated from time to time. When a new version is
        published, your continued use of StepFit after the updated Terms
        become effective will be interpreted as acceptance of the new version.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Contact</h2>
